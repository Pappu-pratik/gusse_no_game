# gusse_no_game

Here's a simple "Guess the Number" game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the game gives feedback: too high, too low, or correct.

ðŸ”§ How It Works:
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the game starts.
The user enters a number guess into the input box.
Upon clicking the Submit Guess button:
The game checks the user's input.
It provides feedback.
A Restart Game button allows the user to reset the game and play again.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
HTML â€“ to structure the content.
CSS â€“ for basic styling and layout.
JavaScript â€“ to handle game logic and user interactions.

This project is great for beginners to practice basic DOM manipulation and conditional logic in JavaScript.
